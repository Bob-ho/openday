1 App planning and design:
+ What occasions of the app used for?
 Every student who are the new student or people who want to discover and find more information on the open day about Deakin University. This app contains all the information they need to successfully plan to the day and ensure get the most out of their visit. It provides full details of the day’s activities and include all location, building and times. If they are not sure what course or degree they want to study then this app will point to the right direction and provide full campus map which immediately direct to when they need. In another word, the Open Days app puts all the information they need in the fingertips.
They might expect to answer some of the question: 
How can I find the latest information about the Open day?
How many course are there in the Deakin University especially in Burwood campus.
What course would l apply for? Where I can find more information about my course? Any description? 
How can I leave the feedback or ask some of the questions?
All of that question upon they might go to the website Deakin.edu.au to find more information. However, nowadays many students are different age and country who uses mobile app regularly so they just download it from App store and open it up when they need it, Deakin Open Day provide for them. Importantly, this app makes a bit different than any other about function, designing, interaction and simple for help people more convenience and comfortable when they are going to use it.
+ Service 
The most challenge is how to select the function/service that support for user in the important day that is open day. Good app’s service that will help students to believe the quality of the course they will going to study for next several years and also increase the number of student enrol in. As we all know, Mobile App has a limit of screen size therefore to design what information/service should list on the app is the main key to the app success thus this app should follow some criteria: less words but more meaningful, clearly identify and more detail in each of them, sometime provide the icon or picture beside the word, easy to transfer from each view controller. 
Deakin University have 4 campuses include Melbourne Burwood, Warrnambool Campus, Geelong Waterfront and Geelong Waurn Ponds. For the time limit so we just going to particular campus to design and implement. Melbourne Burwood Campus where many new students attend to the open day.
The service of this app base on the questions as we were mention earlier:
•	News and event: showing the latest information about events, make sure they don’t miss out on activities during the day and find out where the food provides.
•	My Planner: For example for User want to find the department of Health then they just click to the Academic/Research navigation, find the information in this building:  then add to the plaining if they would. So on the open day the system will automatic remain the alert and announcements to show where is that building then the user will be relaxed to get there. 
•	Academic/Research: Burwood Campus has different departments and location, so that Navigation will benefit to user who want to find out the campus like library, study space and department which fully describe and also provide some video and picture for more clearly identify. Used the map to show more clearly location, they also add my planner if they like.
•	General: which provide the some service like outlet, food, international center.
•	Feedback: will allow the user to leave the comment such as the service, help to improve the app then send direct to the information collection.
